## Features
- **Procedurally generated levels:** Each attempt in the game brings a different room pool and layout, ensuring that no two runs are the same.
- **Variety of room types:** Game offers different rooms in the levels, such as secret rooms that the player can discover to secure valuable loot, item rooms in which he can grab some powerful stuff that can help him in his journey or shops in which he can buy things he's needing at the moment.
- **Diverse mechanics:** There is a lot of different game mechanics, such as bombs that the player can place to damage enemies, destroy rocks or reveal secret rooms, pots that can drop pickups upon being destroyed, retractable spikes that can move in and out to damage player, bullets that can split into multiple smaller ones upon hitting the wall or closed doors that require key to be opened.
- **Clean interfaces:** User interface that displays current health of the player, number of the pickups he collected, his statistics and a map of the level that can be enlarged to show a wider area of a floor layout.

Project's design, mechanics and UI were inspired by the game "The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth".
